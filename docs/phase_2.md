# Phase 2: Age Progression System
**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 months

## Overview
Phase 2 implements the core age progression system that defines the game's evolution from primitive to advanced civilizations. This phase focuses on creating a robust framework for age transitions, resource management, and building/unit systems.

  - [ ] Builders
  - [ ] Researchers
- [ ] Create military units:
  - [ ] Warriors
  - [ ] Archers
  - [ ] Siege units
- [ ] Design special units:
  - [ ] Heroes
  - [ ] Age-specific units

### 3.3 Unit Management
