# Phase 1: Core Foundation
**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 months

## Overview
Phase 1 establishes the fundamental architecture and core systems of ChronoCiv: Idle Ascension. This phase focuses on creating a solid foundation that will support all future development phases.

## 1. Project Setup & Architecture

### 1.1 Godot Project Structure
- [ ] Initialize Godot 4.x project
- [ ] Set up project organization:
  ```
  assets/
    ├── sprites/
    ├── audio/
    ├── fonts/
    └── themes/
  scenes/
    ├── ui/
    ├── game/
    └── widget/
  scripts/
    ├── core/
    ├── systems/
    └── utils/
  resources/
    ├── configs/
    └── data/
  ```
- [ ] Configure project settings and export templates
- [ ] Set up version control (Git) with appropriate .gitignore

### 1.2 Core Systems Architecture
- [ ] Design and implement core singleton architecture:
  - [ ] GameManager (main game state)
  - [ ] ResourceManager (resource handling)
  - [ ] TimeManager (game time progression)
  - [ ] SaveManager (save/load functionality)
  - [ ] EventBus (signal management)
- [ ] Create base classes for:
  - [ ] Resource types
  - [ ] Building types
  - [ ] Unit types
  - [ ] Task types

### 1.3 Data Structures
- [ ] Design JSON schema for:
  - [ ] Game configuration
  - [ ] Resource definitions
  - [ ] Building definitions
  - [ ] Unit definitions
  - [ ] Age progression data
- [ ] Create data validation system
- [ ] Implement data loading utilities

## 2. Save/Load System

### 2.1 Save System Design
- [ ] Design save file format and structure
- [ ] Implement save file encryption
- [ ] Create save file versioning system
- [ ] Design save file compression

### 2.2 Save Implementation
- [ ] Implement serialization for:
  - [ ] Game state
  - [ ] Resources
  - [ ] Buildings
  - [ ] Units
  - [ ] Progress
- [ ] Create auto-save system
- [ ] Implement save file validation
- [ ] Add save file backup system

### 2.3 Load System
- [ ] Implement save file loading
- [ ] Create save file migration system
- [ ] Add save file corruption recovery
- [ ] Implement save file integrity checks

## 3. Basic Game Loop

### 3.1 Time System
- [ ] Implement real-time progression
- [ ] Create offline time calculation
- [ ] Design time acceleration system
- [ ] Implement time-based events

### 3.2 Resource Management
- [ ] Create resource production system
- [ ] Implement resource storage
- [ ] Design resource consumption
- [ ] Add resource overflow handling

### 3.3 Basic UI Framework
- [ ] Design main UI layout
- [ ] Create UI theme system
- [ ] Implement basic UI components:
  - [ ] Resource displays
  - [ ] Progress bars
  - [ ] Basic buttons
  - [ ] Tooltips
- [ ] Add UI animation system

## 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Create test cases for:
  - [ ] Save/Load system
  - [ ] Resource management
  - [ ] Time calculations
  - [ ] UI components

### 4.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Create benchmark tests
- [ ] Test memory usage
- [ ] Profile CPU usage

## Technical Specifications

### Development Environment
- Godot 4.x
- GDScript
- Git for version control
- JSON for data storage

### Performance Requirements
- 60 FPS target
- < 100MB memory usage
- < 1 second save/load time
- Smooth UI at 1080p

### Code Standards
- Follow GDScript style guide
- Document all public methods
- Use type hints
- Implement error handling

## Dependencies
- Godot 4.x
- JSON parsing library
- Encryption library (for saves)

## Milestones
1. Week 1-2: Project setup and architecture
2. Week 3-4: Save/Load system implementation
3. Week 5-6: Basic game loop
4. Week 7-8: Testing and optimization

## Risk Assessment
- Save file corruption
- Performance issues with large save files
- Memory leaks in long-running sessions
- Cross-platform compatibility issues

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All core systems implemented and tested
- [ ] Save/Load system working reliably
- [ ] Basic game loop functioning
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Core architecture must be stable
- Save system must be reliable
- Basic game loop must be performant
- All core systems must be documented
